This directory contains an HTML media player and station menu,
suitable for use as an Icecast 2 web directory. Place icons with the
same name as radio mounts in `icons/`, and then point Icecast this
way.

The files *status-json.xsl*, *status.xsl*, and *xml2json.xslt* are
copied from the [Icecast sources][ic], just to make it easy to get
going.
